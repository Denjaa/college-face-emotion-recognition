# Facial emotions recognizer

One of my college assignments required me to develop a script that would be capable of doing the following:

1. Create a machine learning model to recognize facial emotions
2. Use persons web camera to capture the persons face and recognize emotion that person is feeling

### NOTE: It took approximatelly 5 hours to create a model to recognize facial emotions. It can be reduced by reducing the number of epochs.
